My solution contains three main methods:
Main will perform both sequential and parallel program and list out similarity and time cost. Main can be called by "gradle run"

SequentialMain is for performing sequential program solely. 

ParallelMain is for performing parallel program solely. 

As for test, there are several repos in resources. Feel free to play with them.
